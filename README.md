# Smart-Table1
The implementation of a smart table as part of a home automation system.

**Hardware:**
To implement the smart table, I have used a Raspberry Pi 3B as the main controller, LCD display, Motion sensor, buzzer, and relay.

**Language:**
As for the language, I have used Python for the main script and HTML and CSS for the webpage. The webpage can be accessed through the IP address of the raspberry pi. As it runs on the IP address of the raspberry pi, through the webpage you can set alarms and reminders, control lights, activate motion sensor lights, and do other things.

> Smart_table.py is the main file.
> The templates folder has all the required files needed for the webpage.
> The snapshots folder contains pictures of the project.
> alarm_db.csv and remainder _db.csv contains the details about the alarm and the remainder.
